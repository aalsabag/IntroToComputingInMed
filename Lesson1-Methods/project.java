        When it comes to improving patient care, redundancy may not be a bad thing. This is as long as
        patient care is stream-lined.

        A nurse is assigned the task of checking the vitals of 6 patients in 3 different rooms.
        Vitals include: Heart Rate, O2 saturation, Blood Pressure, Temperature

        The goal is to display the steps that the nurse must go through to achieve this task.

        The expected output is:
        ```
        Enter room
        Go to patient
        Check heart rate
        Check O2 saturation
        Check blood pressure
        Check temperature
        Go to patient
        Check heart rate
        Check O2 saturation
        Check blood pressure
        Check temperature
        Enter room
        Go to patient
        Check heart rate
        Check O2 saturation
        Check blood pressure
        Check temperature
        Go to patient
        Check heart rate
        Check O2 saturation
        Check blood pressure
        Check temperature
        Enter room
        Go to patient
        Check heart rate
        Check O2 saturation
        Check blood pressure
        Check temperature
        Go to patient
        Check heart rate
        Check O2 saturation
        Check blood pressure
        Check temperature

        ```

        You must print out text using:
        ```
        System.out.println("The text you want to print")
        ```

        In your main method you may not have more than 3 lines of code
        You must utilize at least 2 separate methods
