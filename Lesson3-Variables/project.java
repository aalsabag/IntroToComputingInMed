        There are a lot of calculations those in medicine might need to perform.
        A lot of them you may have heard of in some shape or form. Today we will
        calculate O2 saturation, BMI, BMI prime, Creatine Clearance, and the
        Sodium correction for hyperglycemia

        1. Each of these calculations must be performed according to the specifications
        below.
        2. Write each calculation in its own separate static method.
        
        The methods will be:
        calculateO2() 

        calculateBMI()

        calculateBMIPrime()

        calculateCreatineClearance() - given 3 values of age in years, weight in lbs,
        and creatine concentration in mg/dL calculate the creatine clearance to assess 
        a patients renal function.
        Cockcroft-Gault CrCl, mL/min = (140 – age) × (weight, kg) × (0.85 if female) / (72 × Cr)
        OUTPUT: The creatine clearance rate for a 30 year old 150 pound male with a creatine
        concentration of .7 mg/dL is 148 mL/min

        calculateSodiumCorrection() - given 2 values of sodium (mEq/L) and Glucose
        (mg/dL) calculate the corrected sodium concentration. 
        Corrected Sodium (Hillier, 1999) = Measured sodium + 0.024 * (Serum glucose - 100)
        OUTPUT: The corrected sodium concentration in hyperglycemia for an original sodium
        concentration of 137 mEq/L and 70 mg/dL is 136 mEq/L
