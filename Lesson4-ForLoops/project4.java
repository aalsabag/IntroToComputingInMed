        Due to COVID-19 a hospital is attempting to apply social distancing
        for hospital beds. The hospital has mandated that there be at least a bed 
        between each patient. Occupation of beds is represented by a grid like this.
        *#*#*
        #*#*#
        *#***
        A * represents an unoccupied bed and a # represents an occupied bed.

        The above is a valid orientation.

        You have two jobs. Create both hospital orientations listed below, each in
        their own separate methods, evenBed() and oddBed() respectively.

        *#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
        *#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
        *#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
        *#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
        *#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
        *#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#


        #*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
        *#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*

        Remember to use for loops and the modulus operator to perform both of
        these tasks! You will find them very useful

        You may NOT just print these out directly using System.out.println()
