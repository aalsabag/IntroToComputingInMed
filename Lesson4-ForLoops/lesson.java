        // Let's break that down 
        //  `int i=0;` this declares a variable called i and sets it to 0
        // `i<5;` defines the condition at which we should stop, when i is no longer less than 5
        // i++ defines how much to increment by. i++ notation means increment by 1,
        // that mean i-- means decrement by 1. i+=3 means increment by 3. i-=3 means decrement by 3, etc
